# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in Python, based on the examples and descriptions from [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/pt-br/design-patterns/catalog). Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.12 (version I used for the project)
- Git (optional, only needed if you want to clone the repository)

You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To check if Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

First, clone the repository if you have Git installed. If not, you can simply download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

To clone the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LetMarq/Design-Patterns.git
cd Design-Patterns
```

### Running the Examples

Each file in the repository is named according to the design pattern it demonstrates. To run an example, simply navigate to the repository's directory in your command line, and then run the Python file using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

or

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the name of the file you want to run. For example, to run the Factory Method pattern example:

```bash
python factory_method.py
```
